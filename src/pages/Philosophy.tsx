                The cypherpunk movement emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s—a loose coalition of cryptographers, programmers and privacy advocates united by a single conviction: strong encryption should be freely available to individuals, not monopolised by states and corporations.

                The name blends "cipher" (encryption) with "cyberpunk", reflecting both technical focus and countercultural attitude. Key figures included Eric Hughes, Tim May, John Gilmore and later Julian Assange and Hal Finney. They communicated via the Cypherpunks mailing list, sharing code, ideas and paranoia in equal measure.

                Crypto anarchism is the political philosophy that emerged from cypherpunk practice. First articulated by Tim May in his 1988 manifesto (distributed at a hacker conference on printed sheets), it makes a simple but radical claim: cryptographic tools will inevitably undermine the state's ability to surveil, tax and regulate.
              </p>
              <p>
                This isn't advocacy—it's prediction. May wasn't campaigning for anarchism; he was observing that strong encryption, anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous communication would make centralised control technically infeasible. The tools would exist. People would use them. Governments couldn't stop mathematics.

              May predicted assassination markets, untraceable information trading and the emergence of "crypto-anarchy" as a parallel economy. Some predictions proved accurate (darknet markets and cryptocurrency). Others remain unrealised or took different forms. But the core insight holds: cryptography shifts power from institutions to individuals.

                We don't advocate for any particular political outcome. We observe that these tools exist, that demand for privacy exists, and that we can provide services at the intersection. What you do with privacy is your business. Literally.

We're not a shield for illegal activity—we're a layer of privacy on top of legitimate infrastructure. The same privacy that protects dissidents protects you from marketing databases. The same anonymity that enables whistleblowers enables you to sign up for a service without surrendering your phone number.
